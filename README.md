A comprehensive machine learning analysis of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine quality using modern gradient boosting models and explainable AI techniques.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes wine quality based on physicochemical properties using advanced machine learning techniques. The analysis has been **completely modernized** with state-of-the-art models and interactive visualizations.

**Dataset:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Red wine:** 1,599 samples
- **White wine:** 4,898 samples
- **Total:** 6,497 wines with 11 physicochemical features

**Target:** Quality score (0-10, rated by wine experts)

## What's New in This Update?

### Advanced Machine Learning Models
- **XGBoost** - Industry-standard gradient boosting
- **LightGBM** - Fast and efficient boosting algorithm
- **CatBoost** - Minimal hyperparameter tuning required
- **Comparison** with traditional models (SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest)

### Explainable AI (XAI)
- **SHAP values** - Understand which features drive predictions
- **Feature importance** - Ranking of most influential variables
- **Model interpretability** - Transparent decision-making

### Multiple Problem Formulations
- **Multi-class Classification** - Predict exact quality scores (4-8)
- **Binary Classification** - Classify as "Good" (7-8) vs "Not Good" (4-6)
- **Regression** - Continuous quality score prediction

### Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering** - Discover natural wine groupings
- **Dimensionality Reduction** - PCA and UMAP visualizations
- **Interactive 2D/3D plots** - Explore wine similarity

### Interactive GitHub Pages Dashboard
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile
- **Interactive charts** - Plotly.js visualizations
- **Live predictor** - Test wine quality predictions
- **Modern UI** - Clean, professional interface

## Key Results

| Model | Test Accuracy | Cross-Val Mean |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **LightGBM** | **~72%** | **~71%** |
| CatBoost | ~71% | ~70% |
| XGBoost | ~70% | ~69% |
| Random Forest (Baseline) | ~68% | ~67% |

**Top Predictive Features:**
1. Alcohol content (strongest positive predictor)
2. Volatile acidity (negative predictor)
3. Chlorides (negative predictor)
4. Sulphates (positive predictor)
5. Density (negative predictor)

## Analysis Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Outlier removal using Z-score method (|z| > 3)
- Feature engineering (total acidity, sulfur ratios, etc.)
- Train-test split (70/30)
- Standardization for model compatibility

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution analysis
- Interactive visualizations

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- Multiple model comparison
- Cross-validation (5-fold)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Comprehensive metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

### 4. Model Interpretation
- SHAP value analysis
- Feature importance ranking
- Individual prediction explanations

### 5. Clustering Analysis
- Optimal cluster discovery (elbow method)
- Cluster characterization
- 2D visualization (PCA, UMAP)

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The interactive dashboard is automatically deployed via GitHub Pages from the `docs/` folder.

### To Update the Dashboard:

1. Run the updated Jupyter notebook to generate all visualizations
2. Ensure all HTML files are in the `docs/` folder
3. Commit and push changes
4. GitHub Pages will automatically update

### Local Preview:

```bash
# Serve the docs folder locally
cd docs
python -m http.server 8000

# Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Using the Wine Quality Predictor

The interactive dashboard includes a live predictor where you can:

1. **Use presets:** High Quality, Average, or Low Quality wine profiles
2. **Enter custom values:** All 11 physicochemical properties
3. **Get instant predictions:** Quality score and category

**Note:** The browser-based predictor uses a simplified heuristic model. For accurate predictions, use the trained LightGBM model from the notebook.

## Key Insights

### Model Performance
- Gradient boosting models significantly outperform traditional Random Forest (~4% improvement)
- Binary classification (Good vs Not Good) achieves higher accuracy (~80%)
- Regression approach provides continuous estimates with low RMSE

### Wine Quality Factors
- **Alcohol content** is the strongest quality predictor (positive correlation)
- **Volatile acidity** strongly predicts lower quality
- **Wine type** (red vs white) influences quality patterns
- **4 natural clusters** discovered with distinct flavor profiles

### Business Applications
- Quality control automation
- Recipe optimization
- Consumer preference prediction
- Anomaly detection for exceptional wines
